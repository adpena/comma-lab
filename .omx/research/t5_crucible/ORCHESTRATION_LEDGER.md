# T5 CRUCIBLE — ORCHESTRATION LEDGER (durable; any session resumes from here)

Convened: 2026-07-07 (operator, verbatim in convening record §1).
Record: `.omx/research/T5_crucible_convening_arm_A_full_stack_20260707.md`
Grounding: `.omx/research/t5_crucible/GROUNDING_PACKET_20260707.md`
Dossier: `.omx/research/DRAFT_derived_optimal_next_run_for_council_20260707.md`

## Protocol phases
- [x] P0 grounding (never-fired 36 enumerated; 113 unmapped DSL flags; ledger-semantics caveat)
- [ ] P1 independent positions (6 seats, anti-anchored, STAGGERED 2 waves of 3 for rate limits)
- [ ] P2 red-team pre-mortem (reads all positions; "how this fails to move the pointer")
- [ ] P3 debate round(s) (≥2; disagreements enumerated)
- [ ] P4 EMPIRICAL RECESS (measurable disputes → n600-real data; HVP-Lanczos first; serial, governed)
- [ ] P5 synthesis (one stack; survives second red-team pass)
- [ ] P6 #363 self-reflection seal (assumption tags; PROVISIONAL where unmeasured)
- [ ] P7 deliverables 1-7 assembled (DSL WitnessProgram · ledger resolution · schedule ·
      costate · curriculum · measurement plan · wall-clock plan) — triality-consistent landing

## Seats (P1)
| Seat | Charter | Wave | Status | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 BASIS | Daubechies/Mallat — Arm A basis design (along-tangent bandwidth, bank ladder, activation, chroma) | 1 | LAUNCHED | position_S1_basis_20260707.md |
| S2 SCHEDULE+CURRICULUM | witness-native derivation; PR95 cargo-cult audit table; stages/exits/priming | 1 | LAUNCHED | position_S2_schedule_curriculum_20260707.md |
| S3 CONTROL/COSTATE | SENSE→DECIDE→ACT; GN/Fisher 2nd-order wiring; HVP-Lanczos probe design; trust-region | 1 | LAUNCHED | position_S3_costate_20260707.md |
| S4 RATE | Shannon — two-regime allocation, weight-entropy, #157 compress-half, derive-H, byte accounting | 2 | QUEUED | position_S4_rate_20260707.md |
| S5 LEVER-LEDGER | Fridrich/Yousfi — 36 never-fired per-lever BUILD/DEFER; annulus geometry; lane-band; islands | 2 | QUEUED | position_S5_lever_ledger_20260707.md |
| S6 POSE+BYTE-CLOSE | §5B pose ON/OFF; store-nothing carrier; byte-close + exact-eval path readiness; measurement-plan skeleton | 2 | QUEUED | position_S6_pose_byteclose_20260707.md |

## Rate-limit resilience rules
- Waves of ≤3 concurrent seats; wave 2 launches when wave 1 returns (or one at a time if limits bite).
- All context via durable files + pointers (no giant inline prompts).
- Seats checkpoint positions incrementally → a killed seat is resumed by relaunching with
  "continue position_S<N> from its current on-disk state".
- Every phase output committed immediately (serializer, [no-triality]).

## Recess queue (P4; grows from positions + red-team)
1. $0 HVP-Lanczos GN/Hessian spectrum on saved #205 checkpoint (pinned §2 first-measurement).
(…seats append here via their RECESS proposals…)

## Log
- 2026-07-07T~18:00 convening record committed (294fb8119).
- 2026-07-07T~19:0x session cut (rate limits) before seat launch; recovery confirmed ZERO signal
  loss (no seats had launched). P0 re-grounded; wave 1 launching.
